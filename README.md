# Lila Legibility

Lila is a command-line tool to evaluate legible behavior of robot manipulators.

It features a dataset of human-rated manipulator behaviors performing a pick-up
task (see the example video below) which can be used to evaluate new legibility
metrics and compare their performance against a set of existing metrics.


## Getting Started

```python
pip install <TODO>
```

## Contributing

You are very welcome to contribute new features to this tool or improve existing
ones. Here is a (non exthaustive) list of things that you could contribute:

- New legiblity models that beat existing models on the provided benchmark dataset
- Issues regarding unclear documentation or suggestions for improvement
- Implementations of existing legibility models
- Human ratings of new trajectories in existing environments
- A new evaluation environment (with accompanying human ratings)
- Improvements to any of the above
- Ideas or suggestions for new features
